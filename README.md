# Link-Prediction
Link prediction in graph data

This is the project I developed for my undergraduate ECE Thesis. 

The main idea of the thesis is to develop and compare numerous pre-existing link prediciton techniques, and also combine them in a more efficient way.
Three different techniques were chosen:

* Node2Vec 
* CTDNE
* GraphSAGE
